# [IP5] Navigation In VR Space - University of Applied Sciences FHNW

With the commercially available HTC Vive it is possible to dive into virtual dream worlds and experience them in person. Such virtual worlds are beautiful, but there are factors that make these worlds less immersive than the real world. One of these factors is the limited tracking space. This limited tracking space can be overcome with new inventive navigation methods.

To find such navigation methods we researched various virtual reality papers which mostly used older non commercially available equipment. We took some of their ideas and created a navigation method prototype containing five different methods: Teleportation, jumping, walking in place, walking by leaning and scaled walking.

With the created prototype we tested each navigation method on quality factors like speed, ease of learning or the presence. The results of those quality aspects helped us making suggestions for the usage of the navigation methods.

The suggestions give insights and a possible edge to virtual reality developers.
